# Youtube thumbnail tester

 I noticed that there is no built-in feature on YouTube to simulate how your thumbnail would appear in the youtube recommendations. Consequently, many YouTubers resort to the time-consuming process of importing screenshots of YouTube recommendations from their phones into Photoshop and then overlaying their thumbnail and title. To address this issue, I developed this application to automatically align your uploaded thumbnail and text to a YouTube recommendation screenshot. With this app, you can simply write and upload your thumbnail, and it will automatically align everything for you. The URL is [youtubethumbnailtester.com](https://youtubethumbnailtester.com/)
